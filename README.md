# Streaming Anomalies Demos #


## Description ##

The scope of this project is to show basic use cases on how the online statistics library can be used to detect
anomalies in data streams.
More information can be found in the [demos](docs/demos.md).

The main advantage of this approach is the small time and space complexity of producing this statistical data, as shown
in the main [`online-stats`](https://github.com/tupol/online-stats) library.
